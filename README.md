I'm a UC Berkeley student studying electrical engineering and computer science with a passion for solving medical problems with AI & ML software solutions. I have used TensorFlow and MATLAB to detect the presence of H. pylori bacteria within a whole slide image at Boston University School of Medicine. I'm also passionate about autonomous systems and intelligent robotics.
